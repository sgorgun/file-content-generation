##  File Content Generation.

The program currently has a type system in place that generates files with random content.

The goal is to create a code solution that is more efficient and easier to maintain - modify this type system by identifying the necessary abstractions and implementing them. This new solution should be placed in the `FileContentGeneration.Solution` project.

Additionally, unit tests should be developed to ensure that the new solution is functioning correctly. These tests should be placed in the `FileContentGeneration.Solution.Tests` project.
